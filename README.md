# Structural Health Monitoring Using Sound Waves and AI
This repository demonstrates the use of AI and machine learning for structural health monitoring and crack detection in buildings and infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Detect cracks in structures using sound wave data with 92% accuracy.
- Reduce false positives in structural analysis by 18%.
- Predict structural failures through sound wave analysis using ML/DL models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy)
- **Databases:** SQL and Snowflake for large dataset management.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn for analysis and results presentation.

## Key Contributions
1. Developed ML/DL models for analyzing sound wave data.
2. Improved crack detection accuracy using neural networks.
3. Preprocessed and analyzed over 10,000 sensor readings for structural failure predictions.
4. Optimized data storage and processing using Snowflake and SQL.
